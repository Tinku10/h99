import Data.List (group)
-- (**) Determine the prime factors and their multiplicities of a given positive integer
 

-- Construct a list containing each prime factor and its multiplicity.

-- Example:

-- * (prime-factors-mult 315)
-- ((3 2) (5 1) (7 1))
-- Example in Haskell:

-- Î»> prime_factors_mult 315
-- [(3,2),(5,1),(7,1)]
