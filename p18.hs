-- (**) Extract a slice from a list
 

-- Given two indices, i and k, the slice is the list containing the elements between the i'th and k'th element of the original list (both limits included). Start counting the elements with 1.

-- Example:

-- * (slice '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3 7)
-- (C D E F G)
-- Example in Haskell:

-- λ> slice ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i','k'] 3 7
-- "cdefg"

slice :: [a] -> Int -> Int -> [a]
slice xs l r = take (r - l + 1) $ drop (l - 1) xs

main = do
  print $ slice "abcdefghik" 3 7
