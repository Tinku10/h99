-- (**) Generate combinations of K distinct objects chosen from the N elements of a list


-- In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of 12 people? We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220 possibilities (C(N,K) denotes the well-known binomial coefficients). For pure mathematicians, this result may be great. But we want to really generate all the possibilities in a list.

-- Example:

-- * (combinations 3 '(a b c d e f))
-- ((A B C) (A B D) (A B E) ... )
-- Example in Haskell:

-- Î»> combinations 3 "abcdef"
-- ["abc","abd","abe",...]
