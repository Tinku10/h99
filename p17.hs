-- (*) Split a list into two parts; the length of the first part is given


-- Do not use any predefined predicates.

-- Example:

-- * (split '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3)
-- ( (A B C) (D E F G H I K))
-- Example in Haskell:

-- Î»> split "abcdefghik" 3
-- ("abc", "defghik")

split :: [a] -> Int -> ([a], [a])
split xs n = (take n xs, take (length xs - n) xs)
-- split xs n = (take n xs, drop n xs)

main = do
  print $ split "abcdef" 2
  print $ split [1,2..100] 5
